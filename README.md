Detailed Project Description: Household Power Consumption Analysis and Prediction
1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict household power consumption using historical data. The dataset includes minute-by-minute power consumption data for a single household in Sceaux (7 km from Paris, France) from December 2006 to November 2010.

2. Data Collection
The dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. The dataset contains various features such as global active power, global reactive power, voltage, global intensity, and sub-metering values. The dataset can be accessed here.

3. Data Ingestion
The following Python libraries are used for data ingestion and analysis:

numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
warnings: To handle any warning messages during the analysis.
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv() with a semicolon separator.

4. Data Cleaning
Initial data cleaning involves:

Checking the data types of each column.
Identifying and handling missing values.
Since the dataset is extensive, a sample of 100,000 rows is selected for the analysis to make the processing manageable.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves:

Visualizing the distribution of power consumption over time.
Analyzing patterns and trends in the data.
Identifying any anomalies or outliers in the dataset.
6. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are identified and either filled with appropriate values or dropped, depending on the context.
Data Type Conversion: Converting columns to appropriate data types, such as converting power consumption values to numeric types.
Feature Scaling: Standardizing the features to ensure all variables contribute equally to the model performance.
7. Feature Engineering
New features are created to enhance the predictive power of the models:

Time-based features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month of the year.
Aggregated features like daily or weekly power consumption.
8. Model Building
Several regression models are built and evaluated:

Linear Regression: A simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that splits the data into different branches to make predictions.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
9. Model Evaluation
Performance metrics are calculated to evaluate the models:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing a measure of error in the same units as the target variable.
RÂ² Score: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Training and Testing Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on training and testing data to assess overfitting.
10. Conclusion
The project concludes by comparing the performance of the different models. The Random Forest Regressor typically performs the best due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning.
